# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, written in Python.

## Introduction

Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. This implementation allows you to play against the computer.

## Rules

1. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.
2. Each card has a value: 
   - Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
   - Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
3. Each player is dealt two cards initially, and one of the dealer's cards is hidden.
4. Players can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn).
5. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
6. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
7. After all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hidden card and plays their hand.
8. The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
9. The player with the highest hand value that does not exceed 21 wins. If there is a tie, the game is a push and the bet is returned.
